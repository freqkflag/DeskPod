# DeskPod Project Document
1. Project Overview
Project Name: DeskPod
Summary: DeskPod is a project designed to provide Ubuntu users with a seamless way to switch between multiple desktop environments (DEs) without the risk of dependency conflicts or system instability. By using containerization technology, each desktop environment runs in its own isolated "pod" while maintaining access to the user's home directory, ensuring a consistent and personalized user experience across all installed DEs.
2. Project Goals
The primary goals of the DeskPod project are to:
 * Reduce Dependency Conflicts: Isolate each desktop environment within a container to prevent package and dependency issues that often arise when multiple DEs are installed on a single system.
 * Maintain User Consistency: Allow users to access their personal files, settings, and profile data from within any containerized desktop environment.
 * Provide a Seamless User Experience: Develop a simple, intuitive graphical interface that allows users to switch between desktops with a single click.
 * Support Multiple Ubuntu Flavors: Ensure the system is compatible with and can manage a variety of desktop environments, including GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and others.
3. Key Features
 * Containerized Desktop Environments: Each DE runs in a separate, lightweight container (e.g., LXC or Docker).
 * Profile Persistence: The user's home directory is mounted into each container, preserving files, settings, and personal data.
 * Intuitive GUI: A simple menu-based application allows users to select and launch their desired desktop environment.
 * Dynamic Switching: The application can stop one DE container and start another on the fly.
4. Technical Stack
 * Containerization: LXC (Linux Containers) will be the core technology due to its lightweight nature and close integration with the Linux kernel, making it ideal for running full desktop environments.
 * Programming Language: Python will be used to develop the main control application.
 * GUI Library: PyGTK will be used to create the graphical user interface, as it is a standard on many Linux systems and integrates well with the GTK-based GNOME desktop.
 * Configuration: A simple JSON or YAML file will store the configuration for each available desktop environment, allowing for easy expansion.
5. Project Roadmap
Phase 1: Proof of Concept
 * Install and configure LXC on a host Ubuntu system.
 * Create a base container image.
 * Install a single desktop environment (e.g., GNOME) inside the container.
 * Configure the container to mount the user's home directory.
 * Develop a basic shell script to start and stop the container from the command line.
Phase 2: GUI Development
 * Install a Python GUI library (PyGTK).
 * Create a JSON configuration file to list the available desktop environments.
 * Develop a Python application that reads the configuration file and dynamically creates a menu of buttons.
 * Implement the button-click logic to call the necessary container management commands (lxc-start, lxc-stop).
Phase 3: Session Management
 * This is the most challenging phase. We will need to solve how the graphical session of the containerized DE is displayed on the host system's monitor.
 * Explore and test different methods, such as sharing the X11 socket, using X11 forwarding, or implementing a VNC server within the container.
 * Integrate a robust display management solution into the Python application.
Phase 4: Packaging and Distribution
 * Create a .desktop file to allow the DeskPod application to appear in the Ubuntu application menu.
 * Write a clear README.md file with installation and usage instructions.
 * Package the application as a deb file or a Snap for easy installation on Ubuntu systems.
 * Publish the project on a platform like GitHub.
This document outlines the scope and direction of the DeskPod project. It's a great starting point for us to build from.
